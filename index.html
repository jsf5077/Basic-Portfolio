            Now this is a story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down. And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there. I'll tell you how I became a graphic artist of a town called Willow Grove (yeah.. that's how it goes right?). Now, I was not born and raised in West Philadelphia, but the Philly suburbs is only a thirty-minute drive. I didn't have to worry about any knuckleheads making trouble in my neighborhood. Nor do I have an Aunt on the west coast willing to put up with my antics. That being said, I do like my story so far. If my life was a series of books, you could say that I'm in the process of closing the final chapter of one book working on the next. The good thing about this is I don't know where this final chapter is heading, but the denouement will be a rollercoaster ride to close out the last five years of my life. Then I get to start brand new with a fresh first page as I code my way to being a developer.

            But first, a brief summary of the series so far. The beginning of the series starts with me growing up in Dublin, PA where at an early age it was already clear that I had a creative gift. Moving to where I live now, I continued to develop that gift off and on as I carried on through school (referred to as the dark ages in the series). It was towards the end of the dark ages that things began to spice up. I met my beautiful fiance who has been by my side ever since. Together we have made beautiful memories and together we have triumphed when times were at their darkest. Losing our childhood friends to separate tragedies were very dark times and I was lucky that we had each other to help carry on. She has been my rock and in a lot of ways, she's responsible for many of the good things people say about me.  
        </p>

            The next book in the series brings us to my education at Penn State where my creative side really flourished. It is where I developed my desire to not belong to just one medium; contrary to the standard that most artists follow. I began to experiment with all forms of art; from three-dimensional animation to oil paints and even live-theatre. The valuable lesson I gained from this experience was the ability to perceive an issue and have various ways to attack it with knowledge gained in another field. That alone has saved my skin time and time again. Being a Jack of all trades has its benefits. 
        </p>    
        <p>
        This brings us up to the end of one book and the start of another where I graduated with my art degree and got my job as a graphic artist. The beginning was rough as I adjusted from school life to work life, but eventually it came naturally. For the most part, it has been fun working on signs for companies and it's been rewarding to see a piece of my soul in my neighborhood whenever I would drive past a sign project I worked on. The problem is I got too comfortable where I am and there was no more room for growth at where I work. It was time for a bold move and that brings us up to today.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided that it was time to challenge myself again and take control of my situation. As you read this I am actively pushing myself to learn how to become a web developer. As I write the ending to the book that defines my graphic artist experience, I look forward to bringing over the life lessons I have gained as I start applying fresh ink to the next book in my life.
